[Link to Project](https://github.com/August-Leo/Directing_Customers_Subscription)

In Today's Market, many companies have a mobile presence. Often, these companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. Some examples of paid products which originate from free ones are 'YouTube Red', 'Pandora premium' etc. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.

The objective of this model is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to 'convert' them to paid users. 

Functional Domain: Fintech
Technical Domain: Predictive Modeling

Algorithms/Approach: Feature engineering,Feature scaling,Logistic Regression,GridSearch


## Banking Customer Subscription Analysis

There is decline in revenues for a Portuguese bank. Root cause is clients not depositing as frequently as before. Term deposit allow banks to hold onto investments for a specific amount of time. These deposits --> invest in higher gain financial products == Profit Or, customers can be persuaded to buy other products such as funds or insurance == further increased revenues. Hence, goal is to identify likely customers and focus marketing budgets on them.  

The objective of this model is to predict if client will subcribe to term deposit or not.

Functional Domain: Banking
Technical Domain: Predictive Modeling

Algorithms/Approach: Feature engineering, Class imbalance handled using up sampling and down sampling simultaneously, Feature Selection, Random Forest.


## Stackoverflow : Tag Prediction

[Link to Project](https://github.com/August-Leo/Stackoverflow_Tag_Prediction)

Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their programming knowledge, and build their careers.

Stack Overflow is something which every programmer use one way or another. Each month, over 50 million developers come to Stack Overflow to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Digg. 

Based on the type of tags assigned to questions, the top eight most discussed topics on the site are: Java, JavaScript, C#, PHP, Android, jQuery, Python and HTML. 

The objective of this model is to suggest the tags based on the content that was there in the question posted on Stackoverflow.

Functional Domain: Internet (Online learning)
Technical Domain: Natural Language Processing, Predictive modeling (Multilabel classification)

Algorithms/Approach: Multilabel classification(Performance metric Micro F1 Score), SQLLite to manage data, Tags Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Logistic Regression with OneVsRest Classifier.
